One paper following one side of the double move - the other the other
Blood is invisible - see quote marked in Anidjar's - revealed at two key moments in history: martyrs and Eucharist. Out of history - parousia - or is that the flesh?


## Anidjar

* The twofold move of Christianity [[20170420.5]]
* Christian blood. The Christian theological understanding of blood has been translated, or better transubstantiated, into the secular concept of race. Anidjar argues that the genealogical origin of modern secular racism is Christianity.
*   Anidjar Old Testament Citations [[20170326.2.05]]
 * Anidjar new testament citations [[20170326.2.06]]
 * use  referece to cross check Patristic citations of these Bible verses
 * Eucharist
     * Levering, Sacrifice and Community
     * Does the blood of the Eucharist make new? 
     * Eucharist + Sin?
 * If not here then where? Where does this idea for the conflation of blood and “race” come from?
 * Bauman - flow
 * flesh and blood in midrash - this concept is just in the theologoumen, not necessarily Christian origin - find the date of the text that Boyarin is referencing on p. 64. [[20170412.13]]
 * the sentiment in this relate to Ephrem's Hymn on the Unleavened Bread - the same thing both kills and cures. 
* probably the most useful contribution of anidjar's critique to my thinking has been the suggestion of the "double move"
* to question of what is Christianity? or to my question: what is Christian philosophy - the double gesture points to a both/and or an either/or - a Heisenberg principal-like dynamic 
* is this the Eucharist? "Or is the toxic body that colective body that biopoliticaly inoculates itself against a stronger toxin by afordirigitself homeopathic amounts of a “negative" toxin (disabled bodies) While remaining in aterible tension with these negated entities? Given my condition, Imust constantly renegotiate, and recalibrate, my embodied experiences of intimacy, altered afect, and the porousness of the body. The nature of metal poisoning, acumulated over decades, is that any and every organ, including my brain, can bear damage. Because symptoms can reflect the toxicity of any organ, they form a laundry list that includes cognition, proprioception, emotion, agita~ tion, muscle strength, tunnel perception, joint pain, and nocturnality. Metal—borne damage to the liver’s detoxification pathways means that Icanot sustain many everyday toxins:"

##Christian Ethnos // Christian Racism : Race Theory [[20170326.2.09]]

##Blood Groups
* There are a number of Greek words which would be explicitly useful as an expression of this theory of blood and race. 
* SUNAIMA [[20170419.7]] "kindred blood"
* OMAIMOS [[20170419.8]] "same blood" [[20170424.10]]
* AIMATWSIS [[20170419.10]] - "changing into blood"
* αἱματοποιητικός - "blood-making [[20170419.11]]
* ἔναιμος [[20170419.12]] - "with blood in one"
* we don't get any traction in Christian authors with these words.





## Blood // Disease // Sin

* sin in the blood? 
* could the idea of sin as a disease that needs to be treated by a divine physician - or divinely appointed one - be a connection to blood? 
* inspired by reading the Didascalia
* what is the connection between blood and medicine in the ancient world? 
* Galen? 
* Aristotle? 
* Foucault vol. 2? 
* Or could this be yet another arrow that points to the middle ages?
* what is the relation to disease and blood in ancient medicine? 
* Morbus [[20170326.2.10]]
* MIASMA [[20170326.2.08]]

## Blood // Martyrdom // Politics


* [[20170326.2.03]] in this example from the Martyrdom of the Captives of Beth Zabdai we see an injunction to unite the blood of his people with the blood of the martyrs of the East. 
* still in this case, the reference is to blood that has been spilled more than it is to blood that is circulating through veins. Nevertheless, there is a sense of unity or unificability (join ability) that blood presents. Yet again, the community is formed through a shared sacrifice of blood, but the symbolic valence is obvious from the phrasing: it is a community united by blood. 
* And could the community united by a sacrifice of blood (in this case the blood of martyrs) not point symbolically to that same community united by the sacrifice of Christ’s blood, the blood of the lamb? 
* Are the martyrs not imitating Christ in this instance of blood sacrifice - especially if their sacrificed blood will serve to unite the church? 
* nstitutionalization of martyrdom in Eusebius? tk see Greek here [[20170326.7.01]] 
    * further in Eusebius [[20170326.7]]
* a community united by sacrifice - cult of the martyrs [[20170412.12]] "As Richard Payne has demonstrated, “it was only from 410 onward, when the Sasanian king of kings began to patronize Christian institutions, that bishops, monks, and lay patrons established martyrs’ cults openly and industriously in civic and rural contexts.”"
* ascetics and teachers - spiritual fathers and mothers - spiritual genealogies - charismatic authority? 

## Some Function of blood in Early Christian Literature [[20170422.3]]



Origen
* ethnos [[20170326.2.04]] 
* Origen contra Valentinian division - in which the soul with a bad nature necessarily befalls (or is representative of) a bad people (gens). see tk On First Princ. 2.9.5 
* Origen's univeral theology of divine pedagogy and apokatastasis contradicts the division of humanity into different "natures" (phuseis). Now this is a different term than the others we have been discussing but the logic follows. Because all humanity comes from one creator, it stands to reason that creator, because God is also good, would create each human with the capacity for good - and this capacity be not just in their origin or inception but from one aeon to another. [[20170413.1]] First princ. 3.1.23 - all vessels have the potential to become vessels of honor or vessels of shame. 
* As Buell makes clear, the division of peoples is not metaphysical, nevertheless in the present aeon/age some gene/peoples are better than others. They are in flux. The idea becomes pertinent in Origen's consideration of Israel and whether or not it will/has lost the previous nobility of its genos for not joining the Church. [[20170413.2]]
* Hot Origen - physiognomy - “blood boiling” - where does THIS idiom come from?
    * Anidjar may raise other avenues unintentionally that we may need to consider or reconsider - that we should take seriously 
* "Is the soul blood?" Origen's answer,
in the Second Part of the Dialogue with Heraclides (10.20 to 24.24), 


## Tertullian
* blood practices as distinction from Romans - also material soul here [[20170516.22]]


## Ephrem
* Hymn 19
* the rest of the hymns
* Syriac word for blood
* search 


* Nirenberg? 

## OQ
* explanation of the turn to bloodline theory for demarcating class - what happens when the system of capitalism ceases? bloodline theory fills in the gap by making it hereditary? does this translate to Christian identity? shifting empires in the east - Edessa and Armenia? at the moment of revolution, the prior relation vanishes. therefore, it must transfer this relation (psychoanalytic supplement?). The appeal to blood might also happen in cases when it is hard to distinguish - as is the case in Nirenberg's account of lepers in the Crown of Aragon. In the determinable distinction continues to be invisible and indistinguishable but is made all the more personal and visceral. It is not a social grouping, or ritual grouping. It is a biological grouping. Do we see this rhetoric in Ephrem's Edessa or Chrysostom's Antioch?  [[20170420.9]]
